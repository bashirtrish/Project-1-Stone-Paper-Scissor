**Project 1: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in C++ ðŸŽ®** 

As part of the Abu Hadhoud program ( Programming Advices ), I developed a fully functional Rock, Paper, Scissors game in C++. Hereâ€™s what makes it special: 

âœ… *Features:* 
- The user selects the number of rounds. 
- Each round is a battle between the player and the computer. 
- Real-time result display after each round: 
 - If the computer wins a round â†’ Screen turns Red + Bell Sound ðŸ”´ðŸ”” 
 - If the player wins a round â†’ Screen turns Green ðŸŸ¢âœ¨ 
 - If itâ€™s a tie â†’ Screen turns Yellow ðŸŸ¡ 
- After all rounds, the game displays the final result and asks if the player wants to play again. 

âœ… *Technical Breakdown:* 
ðŸ“Œ Structures: 2 
ðŸ“Œ Enums: 2 
ðŸ“Œ Functions: 8 
ðŸ“Œ Procedures: 6 
ðŸ“Œ Main Function: 1 

This project reinforced key programming concepts like *modularity, user interaction, and problem-solving*. 

NOTE :-
I made the project first which is (My Solution), then I Saw the (Instructor's Solution) to learn new ways of thinking, analyzing and programming. After that I practiced the (Instructor's Solution) very well.
